# Final Project Part 1 | A.J. Ferrara | Fall 2020 | 94-870

## A high-level summary of your project
This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project. \

There is a lot more interest in electric vehicles (EVs), so I am going to explore the reasons for the increased interest,  the obstacles that are preventing most people from buying them and showcase the key players and some resolutions to why EV adoption is slow.

A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe the story arc that you hope to achieve.  

Talk about the anticipated call to action and outline your user stories.  

## Call to Action
Be more confident to make the switch to an EV!

## User Stories
Environmentally-conscious consumer \
Gas-powered vehicle owner \
Policy-makers \
Early adopters for new technology


## Outline 
Story arc, etc.

 Setup:  The increased interest in EVs (show sales over time) 
 
 Conflict:  Reasons for slower or no-adoption (battery range, cost...)
 
 Resolution:  Solutions to mitigate conflict

## Data
A couple of paragraphs that document the data and how it will be used 

recent article on global EV range by manufacturer and cost to the consumer  (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/range-evs-major-highway-routes/)

## Method and Medium
Shorthand will be used to build the story.  I will also use Canva to build Infographics.  Tableau or Flourish will be used to build the charts.
