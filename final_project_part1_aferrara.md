# Final Project Part 1 | A.J. Ferrara | Fall 2020 | 94-870

## A high-level summary of your project
There is a lot more interest in electric vehicles (EVs), so I am going to explore the reasons for the increased interest,  the obstacles that are preventing most people from buying them and showcase the key players and some resolutions to address low EV adoption.

## Call to Action
Be more confident to make the switch to an EV!

## User Stories
The user stories will address environmental, range and battery recharging and political benefits to EV ownership.

As an Environmentally-conscious consumer, I would like to understand how EVs are better for the environment.  
As a Gas-powered vehicle owner, I would like to understand now I can drive farther without anxiety.  
As a Policy-maker, I would like to understand how EVs are better for the United States.  

## Outline 

 Setup:  There is an increase in EV sales due to several factors such as: climate change, millenial attitudes, early adopters and policies.
 
 Conflict:  Mass adoption is slow due to range anxiety and cost.
 
 Resolution:  Solutions to mitigate and understand the conflict

## Data
I have found several articles that contain data and charts to help tell the story.

recent article on global EV range by manufacturer and cost to the consumer  (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/range-evs-major-highway-routes/)

#### Call to Action
Show a picture of a hip, happy Tesla owner.


## Method and Medium
Shorthand will be used to build the story.  I would like to use compelling images behind the charts and words.

I will also use Canva to build Infographics.  Some of the datapoints lend well to an infographic because the points may not be entirely related or in a quantity to show on a normal chart.


Tableau or Flourish will be used to build the charts.
