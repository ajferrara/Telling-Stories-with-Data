# Custom OECD Debt to GDP Ratio Chart

The Debt to GDP ratio shows a government's debt from internal and external sources against its GDP.  When the ratio is higher than 100, it means that the Country could be in a risk category with creditors and other nations that have loaned them money.  This 10-year trend shows a starting and ending point from which we can understand where a region stands today, based on the last 10 years of activities to generate revenue and borrow.  Since there are 35 countries, mostly from Europe, it made sense to group the countries by their region.  The next step of analysis would be to drill into a region to see individual country performance.

This chart shows an almost flat rate for Europe, where they stay below 100 (notice that the OECD Average mimics the Europe line.  THis is because the OECD has 28 of the 35 countries from Europe).  Asia & Pacific, driven by Japan, shows the most debt to GDP increase.  North America has also remained relatively flat for this period as well.  South/Latin America has increased their debt to GDP ration substantially in the last six years.

Finally, use Markdown to write a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.
