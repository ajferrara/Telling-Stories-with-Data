# Custom OECD Debt to GDP Ratio Chart

The Debt to GDP ratio shows a government's debt from internal and external sources against its GDP.  When the ratio is higher than 100, it means that the Country could be in a risk category with creditors and other nations that have loaned them money.  This 10-year trend shows a starting and ending point from which we can understand where a region stands today, based on the last 10 years of activities to generate revenue and borrow.  Since there are 35 countries, mostly from Europe, it made sense to group the countries by their region.  The next step of analysis would be to drill into a region to see individual country performance.

This chart shows an almost flat rate for Europe, where they stay below 100 (notice that the OECD Average mimics the Europe line.  THis is because the OECD has 28 of the 35 countries from Europe).  Asia & Pacific, driven by Japan, shows the most debt to GDP increase.  North America has also remained relatively flat for this period as well.  South/Latin America has increased their debt to GDP ration substantially in the last six years.

Bar Chart
This chart was good for point-in-time status.  It shows the same thing as the line chart, but without the trend, the viewer can't be sure the bars always looked that way.

Grid of Charts
Too many charts that were not in any order.  It is difficult to see overall patterns.  This type of chart is good if the viewer knows what they want to focus on, like a specific country.  Otherwise, there are too many separate boxes and lines to absorb and make sense of.

Line Chart
I wanted to see the data over time and capture the increase or decreases.  Ideally, I wanted to only label the first year's ratio and the last year's ratio, but could not figure out how to do it in Flourish.  The trend line allows you to see all the countries or regions on one chart and the use of color (colorbrewer2.0 6-member sequential theme) allowed me to hand pick colors that went together, but still allowed each region to stand out and also be a color that is pleasing to the viewer.
