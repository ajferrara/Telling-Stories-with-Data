# Custom OECD Debt to GDP Ratio Chart


The Debt to GDP ratio shows a government's debt from internal and external sources against its GDP.  When the ratio is higher than 100, it means that the Country could be in a risk category with creditors and other nations that have loaned them money.  This 10-year trend shows a starting and ending point from which we can understand where a region stands today, based on the last 10 years of activities to generate revenue and borrow.  Since there are 35 countries, mostly from Europe, it made sense to group the countries by their region.  The next step of analysis would be to drill into a region to see individual country performance.

This chart shows an almost flat rate for Europe, where they stay below 100 (notice that the OECD Average mimics the Europe line.  THis is because the OECD has 28 of the 35 countries from Europe).  Asia & Pacific, driven by Japan, shows the most debt to GDP increase.  North America has also remained relatively flat for this period as well.  South/Latin America has increased their debt to GDP ration substantially in the last six years.

**'We don't go in order' (Berinato, Good Charts, p. 35)**
The grid of lines charts provides no order to viewing them, other than alphabetical.  It did not appear that Flourish allowed the grids to be sorted by the value.  The bar chart focused the reader to Japan, but was that the insight?  Without a good title or time dimension, it is difficult to know what is good or bad on the chart.  If you really know the data, you might say Portugal is the worst, because Japan's debt is mostly to its own people.  The third chart provides a subtitle that directs the reader to a trend, so using the x-axis and the legend, the reader can see which countries are trending up, down or remaining flat.  Also, I removed the y-axis and stated the timeframe in the subtitle.  My intetion was to keep the reader on the chart and the legend.   


**'We see only a few things at once' (Berinato, Good Charts, p. 37)**
The third chart does the best job of decluttering the countries.  By showing just the regions, the reader can see some overall trends and then drill into a chart with just a region's countries.  Since 28 of the 35 countries are in Europe, it does not make sense to show every country on a chart.  The reader would have to know what they are looking for.  If I had left the lines to countries and grayed them all out except a few, that would have worked also, but I was not sure which countries to focus on, so I decided to show by country.  The grids of line charts provides little ability to make sense of a few grids out of many.  There is just too many grids and since they are in alphabetical order, it is nearly impossible to decipher overall trends.

**'We seek meaning and make connections' (Berinato, Good Charts, p. 39)**
The third chart does the best job at helping the reader derive meaning from what is presented becasue it uses time, colors and a subtitle to help the reader find meaning.  Chart one is just one year of data, so without more context, it will be difficult to draw any conclusion other than high bars versus low bars.  The grid of lines charts are too cluttered and out of order to arrive at somerthing meaningful.

**'We rely on conventions and metaphors' (Berinato, Good Charts, p. 42)**
The grid of lines charts uses one color for the trend line.  For this reason, it is impossible to differentiate good from bad trends.  For the third chart, I went with colorbrewer2 set of colors that were pleasing to the reader, but did not try to paint one line as better or worse than the other line.  I want to leave that decision to the reader.  By looking at ten years of data, the reader can see which regions are doing better or worse.  Furthermore, I decided to label the lines with the values, but Flourish would not allow me to only label min and max values.  I also wanted to label each line's region, then, I could have removed the legend.  The background is used to hide the horizontal gridlines, which I could not figure out how to remove from Flourish.
