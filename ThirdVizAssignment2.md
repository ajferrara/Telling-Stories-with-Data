# Custom OECD Debt to GDP Ratio Chart

Experiment with the placement of the variables until you find something that shows the data in a different way, or perhaps might be suited for a different audience.  Go through the same steps you did before to customize the visualization to your liking, and post your generated code and description under the grid of line charts plot on your portfolio page.  

Using what you've learned about color, crafting for clarity and selecting chart types so far, build your own data visualization in a way that satisfies the guidelines you've been following in your sketching exercises. 

Modify the color scale to use a custom set of colors you've selected.  Make sure your color selections work correctly and are complimentary to the data you're representing.  Remember you can use tools like Colorbrewer2.org or color.adobe.com to identify color scales that might work best for your needs. 

Make sure you clearly identify data elements as necessary and include a clear title and brief description for your visualization once embedded on your page.  

Finally, use Markdown to write a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.
