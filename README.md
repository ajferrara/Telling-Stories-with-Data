MS-BIDA at Carnegie Mellon University - class 'Telling Stories with Data' - Fall 2020


# About Me
I am a remote student from the General Motors Technical Education Program.\
I have been working with data, business intelligence and data analytics for the past 17 years at GM. \
For the past three years (along with this program), I have been working on text mining and machine learning against diagnostic trouble code data.\
I enjoy using Tableau, SQL, Python and Spark to collect, wrangle and analyze/visualize data.

After I finish this program, I plan to continue applying what I have learned on the job, as I deliver analytics projects.\
I would also like to compete on some Kaggle competitions and build up my GitHub portfolio of machine learning/vizualization projects.\
I also have an MBA and a B.S. in Decision Science.

I was born in Italy and love going back to see my relatives (and eating all the delicious food!).\
I am married with three kids (Isabella (13), Luca (11) and Emma (8).\
I love to travel, watch Netflix/Prime, cook, garden and play tennis.

# What I Hope to Learn
I hope to learn how to visualise data better in terms of technique and context.  I also like the concept of using GitHub to manage the content and showcase my portfolio.
