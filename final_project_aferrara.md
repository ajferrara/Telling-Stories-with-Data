# Final Project| A.J. Ferrara | Fall 2020 | 94-870


A final project Github page that summarizes all the work you've done thus far to create your final project.  You don't need to re-write or recreate content you've already created for parts I and II of this assignment as long as it's organized in an easy-to-follow way.  This document should serve as a kind of "behind the scenes" look at how you created your work.  When reviewing Part III of your final assignment, I should be able to clearly follow along in your progress - noting how you used everything you've created in Part I and Part II to develop your final project. 

Your final project page should include links / references to everything you've used. Make sure that your final project page includes all of the following (Parts I, II and III), at a minimum: 

The idea (Part I)
* [Final Project: Part 1](/final_project_part1_aferrara.md)

The project outline (Part I)
'A high-level summary of your project.  (Part I)
A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story. (Part I)
A short paragraph that documents your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. (Part I)
A link to the publicly-accessible data you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. (Part I)
A few paragraphs summarizing your approach to the project (method and medium - Part I)


Design and user research (Part II)
* [Final Project: Part 2](/final_project_part2_aferrara.md)

Sketches and storyboards (Part II)
User research protocol and findings (Part II)
Wireframes (Part II)


Final data story (Part III)

After the Interviews and Crtiques from classmates, I have revised my target audience and presentation.  The target audience is anyone who is not familiar with Electric Vehicles and would benefit from a review of the pros and cons.  I realized that this audience may not know current electric vehicle brands and models, so I removed them from the presentation.  I decided to make it more clear EV versus Non-EV, instead of Tesla Model 3 versus Toyota Camry.  When I interviewed co-wokers, they understood most of my charts, but during the Crtiques, I saw much more diffuclty in comprehending the charts without me talking, so I revamped many of the chart to contain less data and be more intuitive.  Here are some examples of changes I made after interviews/critiques:

* Instead of flowing from setup -> conflict -> resolution, I combined conflict and resolution.  I got this feedabck from an interview.  By doing this, it helped the audience link the conflict to its resolution.  So, when I talk about climate change,  I then show how EVs can benefit the environment, instead of going onto the next benefit (innovative technology).  
* While the climate change chart was intuitive, it was uninspiring.  I also did not have an EV benefit chart to go with it.  In the interview, I was given the feedback to show the temperatures below zero degrees celsius.  So, I found new data and method for showing global warming that is more impactful.  I also added a chart that shows how EVs are better for the envuironment, especially while using them versus non-EVs.
* Most of my charts were too busy for the class critiques.  I had to explain them.  For example, one benefit to buying an EV is the federal tax credit of $7500.  The chart for this showed all the manufacturers and range of tax credits ($7500 -> $1800 -> expired ($0)).  The point of the chart was to show there are a lot of tax credits, so I changed the chart to show total sales from tax credits and did not talk about the amount.
* Another change from the class critique was to the innovative technology chart.  It was not clear that the EV was the fastest car because the class did not realize Tesla was an EV.  So, I removed all the brands/models and showed just an EV and Non-EV icon racing to a finish line.  This was an idea from Shreyas.
* Another change I made was for the range anxiety chart.  I was trying to show geographically from Pittsburgh, the range that various brands/models of EVs can travel on a full battery.  This chart also required too much explanation, so I simplified it with the EV/Non-EV icons and less information/visuals.
* Finally, the infrastructure conflict (lack of charging stations) was not coming through in my original charts.  So, I decided to focus on an aspect of the insight that was easier to show -- total gas pumps versus total charging pumps.  Originally, I tried to convey total pumps versus vehicles on the road verus time to fill up or charge and this was too complicated to convey.





Shorthand Link:  


Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)

Add a link to your final data story (a direct link to Shorthand / StoryMap / etc.) placed in the final presentation spreadsheet here (Links to an external site.).  Add the link next to your name in the spreadsheet, and update the title to reflect the working title for your presentation.  (Part III)

Include all references for materials used.  It's your responsibility to ensure you have permission to use imagery and other assets, and that you use them appropriately.  A reminder to NOT USE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - see the library's guide to ensure you are using images correctlyLinks to an external site..  Make sure to add / update any citations and / or other content that you used to create your data story.  References should also be clearly identified on your final data story itself.  (Part III)
Include any other information that helps round out your data story. (Part III)
