# Final Project | A.J. Ferrara | Fall 2020 | 94-870

**The idea and outline (Part I)**   
Part I was the initial story outline.  Since then, I have changed the call to action to be more impactful.  Instead of 'When thinking about an EV purchase, consider all the factors', I decided that the story was more pro-EV and should help non-adopters be more informed and possibly look into an EV purchase.  The new call to action is 'Take Another Look at an EV!'.

**Mock-ups and user research (Part II)**  
In Part II, I iterated over each char mock-up and interviewed co-workers and obtained feedback from classmates.  With this new information, I re-worked some charts.

**Final data story (Part III)**  
After the Interviews and crtiques from classmates, I have revised my target audience and presentation.  The target audience is anyone who is not familiar with Electric Vehicles and would benefit from a review of the pros and cons.  I realized that this audience may not know current electric vehicle brands and models, so I removed them from the presentation.  I decided to make it more clear EV versus Non-EV, instead of Tesla Model 3 versus Toyota Camry.  When I interviewed co-wokers, they understood most of my charts, but during the Crtiques, I saw much more diffuclty in comprehending the charts without me talking, so I revamped many of the chart to contain less data and be more intuitive.  Here are some examples of changes I made after interviews/critiques:

* Instead of flowing from setup -> conflict -> resolution, I combined conflict and resolution.  I got this feedabck from an interview.  By doing this, it helped the audience link the conflict to its resolution.  So, when I talk about climate change,  I then show how EVs can benefit the environment, instead of going onto the next benefit (innovative technology).  
* While the climate change chart was intuitive, it was uninspiring.  I also did not have an EV benefit chart to go with it.  In the interview, I was given the feedback to show the temperatures below zero degrees celsius.  So, I found new data and method for showing global warming that is more impactful.  I also added a chart that shows how EVs are better for the envuironment, especially while using them versus non-EVs.
* Most of my charts were too busy for the class critiques.  I had to explain them.  For example, one benefit to buying an EV is the federal tax credit of $7500.  The chart for this showed all the manufacturers and range of tax credits ($7500 -> $1800 -> expired ($0)).  The point of the chart was to show there are a lot of tax credits, so I changed the chart to show total sales from tax credits and did not talk about the amount.
* Another change from the class critique was to the innovative technology chart.  It was not clear that the EV was the fastest car because the class did not realize Tesla was an EV.  So, I removed all the brands/models and showed just an EV and Non-EV icon racing to a finish line.  This was an idea from Shreyas.
* Another change I made was for the range anxiety chart.  I was trying to show geographically from Pittsburgh, the range that various brands/models of EVs can travel on a full battery.  This chart also required too much explanation, so I simplified it with the EV/Non-EV icons and less information/visuals.
* Finally, the infrastructure conflict (lack of charging stations) was not coming through in my original charts.  So, I decided to focus on an aspect of the insight that was easier to show -- total gas pumps versus total charging pumps.  Originally, I tried to convey total pumps versus vehicles on the road verus time to fill up or charge and this was too complicated to convey.

**Final Presentation  (Part III)**   
I struggled with Shorthand to effectively showcase the charts and commentary on the same slides.  However, once I figured this out, I was able to enhance the story with a lot more images.  I do wish that Tableau would fit better within Shorthand - maybe be able to customize the placement and size of the Tableau chart from within Shorthand.  My favorite charts are the two climate change-related ones.  When I showed the story to my mother-in-law, she said she liked those two charts the most as well.  She also liked the overall story and learned new things about EVs.   

I had to use many sources to tell the story, so I feel the story is a little fragmented.  EVs in the US are still in an infancy, dominated by Tesla and most adoption in California.  I did not realize the most of the global growth is in China and Europe, due to these regions being more aggressive to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on oil (gas is more expensive in Europe than in the US).
