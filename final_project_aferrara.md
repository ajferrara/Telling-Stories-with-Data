# Final Project| A.J. Ferrara | Fall 2020 | 94-870


A final project Github page that summarizes all the work you've done thus far to create your final project.  You don't need to re-write or recreate content you've already created for parts I and II of this assignment as long as it's organized in an easy-to-follow way.  This document should serve as a kind of "behind the scenes" look at how you created your work.  When reviewing Part III of your final assignment, I should be able to clearly follow along in your progress - noting how you used everything you've created in Part I and Part II to develop your final project. 

Your final project page should include links / references to everything you've used. Make sure that your final project page includes all of the following (Parts I, II and III), at a minimum:
